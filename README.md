# LSTM-Intent-Detection

A study project in the NLP course within the Artificial Intelligence B.Sc degree @ TH Ingolstadt. 

In a first step the text corpus is transformed into word embeddings from scratch. The embeddings are then visualized by tSNE for clustering purposes. 
After getting an overview over the different clusters, an pytorch LSTM network is trained on embeddings to classify the intents.

The full experiment setup is explained in Intent-Detection-Report.pdf.
